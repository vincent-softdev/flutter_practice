# Widgets
- FittedBox(): A box which you can control the fit of the children inside of it
    .fitHeight: child will fit with the height of the FittedBox. But, will not care about the height
    .fitWidth: same as fitHeight but use for Width
    .cover: cover the size of the box but follow the scale of the original item
    .contain: fit to width or height, but make sure stay inside the fittedBox only and according by the scale
    .scaleDown: Align the source within the target box (by default, centering) and, if necessary, scale the source down to ensure that the source fits within the box. This is the same as contain if that would shrink the image, otherwise it is the same as none.
    .value<>: For deep practice about the fittedBox
